IzoT ShortStack Examples
========================

This directory contains example applications and example driver software for use
with IzoT ShortStack. These examples are grouped by their principal target platform. 

For example, the *rpi* folder, short for *Raspberry Pi*, contains examples designed for use with the Raspberry Pi mini-computer using the Raspbian Linux operating system, or other targets with similar hard- and software.

The examples are designed as an integral part of the IzoT ShortStack repository, and include source code or data from locations within the IzoT ShortStack repository, but possible outside of the *examples* folder.
